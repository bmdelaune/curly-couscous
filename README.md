## Things I would complete if I had time:
1. Wayyy more specs. I did not test negative cases or even write a system spec.
2. I would reduce the dependency on the `lib/open_mateo.rb` file and make it more of an adapter pattern.
3. I wouldn't be including `ActiveModel::API` everywhere for convenience
4. Do more error handling, especially with the OpenMateo API
